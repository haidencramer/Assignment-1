This is my page for assignment 10. I have a css style sheet implemented into my webpage using some elements I am already familiar with as well as new elements I am not so familiar with. This was mainly a way for me to practice styling with css. It's easy to see how beneficial css is opposed to styling everything in your index or each individual page.
