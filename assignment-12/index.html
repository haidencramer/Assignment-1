                    <p>&nbsp;In the United States, grizzly bears only live in a few select places, especially when you only consider the contiguous US (not including Alaska and Hawaii). One of the few small remaining population centers for grizzly bears is in Montana.
                        As it stands, between 1,800 and 2,000 bears live in the state, a reflection of the hard work Montana has done to protect and help the population recover. In fact, Montana is home to the highest number of grizzly bears populations in the United States besides Alaska.
                        Almost all of the grizzly bear sightings in Montana occur in the western portion of the state, although a few sightings in the far east occasionally occur. Nearly all grizzly bears living in Montana as permanent residents live west of Yellowstone County, the most populous county in the state.
                        This county is found just east of Yellowstone National Park, although it gets its name from the Yellowstone River, which bisects the county, not the park itself.
                        The highest density counties for grizzly bears, roughly from east to west, are Carbon County, Gallatin County (with its southern tip dipping into Yellowstone National Park), Madison County, Lewis and Clark County, Missoula County, Glacier County, Flathead County, Lake County, Park County, and Lincoln County.

                                    It's important to remember always carry bear spray when hiking outside in areas where grizzly bears are prevalent. Hiking with a partner or in a group is always reccomended as well.

                    <h1>How to minimize risks:</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;The more paranoid among us may imagine a hike in, say, the Yellowstone or Glacier or Banff wilds is just about guaranteed to involve a grizzly sighting. In reality, your odds of seeing a grizzly are very low. That's partly because the bears are, in most areas, thinly distributed on the landscape. It's also partly because of grizzly activity patterns, and also because the bears are usually alert and keen-sensed enough to smell or hear us coming and hightail it without us ever knowing they're in the vicinity.
                        Certain hiking practices can further reduce the already low odds of directly encountering a grizzly on (or off) the trail. Ideally, you should hike with others in grizzly country. A group of three or more people is much less likely to have trouble with bears: Such a party makes more noise than one or two hikers, for one thing, and is also more intimidating to a griz.
                        In grizzly country, avoid hiking in the early morning or evening hours, when bears—which are often crepuscular and/or nocturnal in habits, especially in landscapes with moderate or heavy human presence—are more likely to be out and about.
                        Making noise is another fundamental of minimizing the chance of surprising a grizzly bear. This doesn't mean you need to be stomping around the backcountry banging cymbals or blasting thrash-metal music from your speakers. Talking at moderate volume is often sufficient. If you're hiking through dense vegetation, along a babbling stream, or in windy weather, you may want to shout (“Hey bear!”) or clap periodically. If you're hiking into the wind, in particular, you should make more noise and otherwise be extra-cautious, given a grizzly upwind is less likely to scent you coming.

                        &nbsp;For all their popularity, bear bells don't carry as far as a loud human voice or handclaps.
                        Keep your eyes peeled for bear signs, which can be quite obvious if you know what you're looking for. Tracks, scat, clawed or rubbed tree bark (perhaps with brownish or silvery hair attached), and torn-open logs or diggings where grizzlies have foraged for roots, insects, or rodents are all examples. If you see plenty of bear signs, and they look (or—ahem—smell) fresh, be especially vigilant; you may even consider leaving the area if there's been a lot of recent bear activity.
                        It's worth highlighting a specific kind of bear sign that's particularly dangerous. If you see an animal carcass—especially a partly buried or obviously fed-upon one—you should backtrack immediately. Grizzlies are enthusiastic scavengers and also occasional predators of hoofed mammals. Meat is a prized, energy-rich food source for the bears, and they will aggressively defend carrion. Grizzlies often rest close to a carcass (sometimes even on top of it), so you should assume a bear may be close by—and apt to be riled-up by your presence—if you see a good-sized dead critter.
