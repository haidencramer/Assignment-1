This is my page for assignment 12. This assignment I made a page about grizzly bears using dropdown, display, position, containers, fonts, and different css elements. This was a lot of fun I enjoyed making the drop down menu a bunch it makes a lot more sense to me now after this assignment how to actually make one.
