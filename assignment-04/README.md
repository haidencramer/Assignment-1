1.  - Browsers are a software program that allows us to access the internet from a device. 
    - They display web pages and allow users to interact with them. 
    - By sending a request over a network (Looking for a website) to a server, it responds with a collection of web content as a response, and the browser interprets this to display to the user. 

2. The DOM is an interface to a document and stipulates how that document is accessed and changed by logically defining its structure. The DOM is not the same as your source code. The DOM is also not a webpage but an essential step in creating one. It also helps connect styling wants to the appropriate structural elements.

3. HTML is the foundation and structure of a page's content. Other aspects can be attached to the page after it's set. XML complements HTML, describing document nodes, whereas HTML displays document nodes. It allows certain elements to be updated without refreshing an entire page. XHTML is essentially a bridge between HTML and XML; it utilizes both to correct problems, particularly those caused by mobile devices. 

4.  - The <!DOCTYPE> declaration element
    - The root element 
    - The head element 
    - The body element 

5. The index.html file is its master file. A site can have multiple index files, but at least one index is the site's homepage. The index file we created for this assignment will display my live website for this course. 

6. Maintaining good naming practices is important because it helps organize files and directories better. Your index.html page has to be saved in the main root folder. Some best naming practices include camel casing (myFile), where the first word is lowercase, and the other word/words are uppercase. I find camel casing to be my favorite naming convention.
