                            <h1>SNOWBOARDING Poem:</h1>
                        
                            <p>
                                
                                In mountains tall where snowflakes dance,
                                A rider stands in fearless stance.
                                Board strapped tight, a winter's call,
                                The thrill of freedom, mountains enthral.
                            </br>
                                Through silent woods and alpine peaks,
                                A journey bold, the snowboard speaks.
                                Carving lines with grace and might,
                                Chasing the day, into the night.
                            </br>   
                                Powder pillows, soft and deep,
                                A canvas vast, where dreams can seep.
                                The mountain whispers tales untold,
                                As fearless hearts in white unfold.
                            </br>  
                                A dance with gravity, a waltz with air,
                                The wind-kissed face, without a care.
                                A symphony of crunching snow,
                                In nature's amphitheater, the riders go.
                            </br>  
                                Tricks and flips, an aerial show,
                                Gravity challenged in a graceful flow.
                                A canvas of white, a boundless stage,
                                In the snowboarder's thrilling engage.
                            </br>  
                                Sunset hues on snow-clad slopes,
                                A winter's poem, where the spirit copes.
                                Through every turn, a story's spun,
                                A love affair with snow and sun.
                            </br>  
                                In the silence of the mountain's crest,
                                A snowboarder finds their best.
                                For in the dance of ice and slope,
                                A soul finds freedom, a heart finds hope.
                            </p>
