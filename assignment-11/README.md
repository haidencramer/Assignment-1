This is my page for assignment 11. With this assignment I created a page for one of my favorite rock bands Deftones. I created a pretty length CSS file as well as used three different fonts I found on the internet that matched the design specifications I was after. I also decided to add a video and unreleased song by the band as well as used hover and text decoration elements.
