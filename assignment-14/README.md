## This is my assignment 14

My final website. This is very sad as I enjoyed this class, I learned a lot of info that I didn't already know from this course. 
For my final site I decided to do an author page again because I have ran out of ideas but I used the Bootstrap framework to style my page.
I had never used bootstrap or javascript before this so it was a fun learning process putting everything together.
