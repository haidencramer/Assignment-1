                                                The story begins with Thomas waking up in a dark, metal elevator, unsure of how he got there. When the doors open, he finds himself in a community of teenage boys called the Glade. The Glade is surrounded by towering walls, and beyond these walls lies a mysterious and ever-changing maze. The boys have been living in the Glade for an unknown amount of time, and none of them have any memories of their past lives.

                                                Alby, the leader of the Glade, explains that the boys' memories are erased before they arrive, and they have established a society with their own rules and roles to survive. The Glade is sustained by supplies sent through the maze by a mysterious organization known as WICKED. The boys' only hope of escaping the Glade is to navigate through the maze, but it's a perilous task because the maze is inhabited by deadly creatures called Grievers.

                                                Thomas, curious and determined, becomes a Runnerâ€”a select group that explores the maze to find a way out. Alongside him is Minho, the lead Runner. Together, they face numerous challenges, decoding the maze's patterns and battling Grievers. Thomas's unique abilities and instincts set him apart, and he becomes a key player in the Glade's attempts to escape.

                                                The arrival of Teresa, the first and only girl in the Glade, further complicates things. She and Thomas share a mysterious connection, and her arrival triggers a series of events that challenge the stability of the Glade. The maze itself begins to act strangely, and the boys suspect that WICKED is conducting experiments on them.

                                                As tensions rise, the Gladers strive to unlock the secrets of the maze and WICKED's intentions. Betrayals, alliances, and sacrifices shape their journey. Eventually, they manage to escape the maze but discover that the challenges are far from over. WICKED reveals that the Gladers were part of an experiment to find individuals with a unique resistance to a deadly virus known as the Flare, which has devastated the world outside.

                                                The Gladers now face a new set of trials in a world ravaged by the Flare, leading them to confront the true nature of WICKED and their role in a grander plan to save humanity. The story continues in subsequent books as the characters navigate the complexities of WICKED's experiments and the consequences of their actions.
