                                        <p class="text-dark">James Dashner is an American author best known for his work in young adult fiction, particularly the "Maze Runner" series. He was born on November 26, 1972, in Austell, Georgia, USA. Dashner began his career as an author in 2008 with the publication of "The Maze Runner," the first book in the dystopian science fiction series that brought him widespread recognition.

                                                Before becoming a full-time writer, Dashner worked in the field of finance. However, he always had a passion for storytelling. His decision to pursue writing led to the creation of several successful book series, including "The Maze Runner Trilogy" ("The Maze Runner," "The Scorch Trials," and "The Death Cure") and its prequel, "The Kill Order."
                                                
                                                "The Maze Runner" series gained popularity for its fast-paced narrative, suspenseful plot, and engaging characters. The books were adapted into a film series, contributing further to Dashner's prominence in the world of young adult literature.
                                                
                                                It's worth noting that in 2018, Dashner faced allegations of misconduct, and his literary agent dropped him. Dashner acknowledged making some "mistakes" in his past interactions, but the specifics of the allegations were not publicly disclosed.
                                                
                                                Despite the controversies, James Dashner has left a significant impact on the young adult fiction genre, and his works continue to be read and appreciated by many readers.
